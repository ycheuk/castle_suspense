Castle Suspense
───────────────
The old Duke was mysteriously murdered the night of the banquet. You, being one of the six suspects of this murder, are in charge of investigating this case to determine who the real suspect is. 

Recently suffering from amnesia, you struggle to find all the missing pieces to the puzzle. Will you be able to determine who the real murderer is? And will you make it out of the castle alive? 


How to Run the Game: 
────────────────────
To play, simply run the main.py file in Python. Reading the tutorial is recommended to understand the mechanics of this mystery game, and reading the commands is also helpful in assisting you to progress throughout the game. 

It is HIGHLY recommended to play this game in a big terminal window (mainly so you can see the map in one sitting).

* There are some Easter eggs hidden in the game, but it is so hidden that I doubt anyone will know what they are *
